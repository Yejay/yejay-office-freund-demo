# Specification Quality Checklist: AG Grid with Preline Design Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

### Content Quality Review

✅ **No implementation details**: The specification focuses on WHAT and WHY without prescribing HOW. Success criteria are user-focused (e.g., "Users can view data in a table that visually matches other application components") rather than implementation-focused.

✅ **Focused on user value**: All user stories clearly articulate value propositions. For example, P1 story emphasizes visual consistency to prevent jarring user experience.

✅ **Written for non-technical stakeholders**: Language is accessible. Terms like "data table," "search bar," "filter" are used instead of technical jargon.

✅ **All mandatory sections completed**: User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements (Functional, Design, Performance, Accessibility), Success Criteria, and Assumptions all present and comprehensive.

### Requirement Completeness Review

✅ **No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers**: All requirements are specified with reasonable defaults documented in Assumptions section. For example, browser support, responsive strategy, and icon library choices are clearly stated in assumptions.

✅ **Requirements are testable and unambiguous**: Each FR, DR, PR, and AR can be objectively verified. Example: "PR-002: Scrolling MUST maintain 60fps when navigating through large datasets" is measurable.

✅ **Success criteria are measurable**: All 12 success criteria include specific metrics. Examples:
- SC-002: "under 5 seconds"
- SC-004: "60fps when displaying 10,000 rows"
- SC-006: "in under 2 clicks"

✅ **Success criteria are technology-agnostic**: No mention of specific frameworks, libraries, or implementation approaches. Focused on user-facing outcomes.

✅ **All acceptance scenarios are defined**: Each of 4 user stories has 5-6 Given/When/Then scenarios covering happy paths and variations.

✅ **Edge cases are identified**: 8 edge cases documented covering empty states, loading states, error handling, mobile responsiveness, and validation errors.

✅ **Scope is clearly bounded**: Assumptions section defines boundaries:
- Dataset size limits (tens of thousands, not millions)
- Browser support scope (modern browsers, no IE11)
- Responsive strategy (can show simplified mobile view)
- Edit permissions handled externally

✅ **Dependencies and assumptions identified**: 10 assumptions documented covering design system availability, data structure, browser support, icon library, state management, etc.

### Feature Readiness Review

✅ **All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria**: 20 functional requirements, plus design, performance, and accessibility requirements all testable through acceptance scenarios and success criteria.

✅ **User scenarios cover primary flows**: 4 prioritized user stories (P1-P4) cover:
- P1: Visual integration (MVP foundation)
- P2: Search and filter (most common operations)
- P3: Sort and paginate (essential for large datasets)
- P4: Advanced operations (power user features)

✅ **Feature meets measurable outcomes**: 12 success criteria align with functional requirements and user stories. Each can be validated without implementation knowledge.

✅ **No implementation details leak**: Spec remains technology-agnostic. Even when user requested specific tech stack (Next.js, AG Grid, Preline), spec focuses on outcomes not implementation.

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`
- No clarifications needed from user
- All requirements are independently testable
- Success criteria provide clear verification points
- Assumptions document reasonable defaults for unspecified details
