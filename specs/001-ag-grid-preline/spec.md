# Feature Specification: AG Grid with Preline Design Integration

**Feature Branch**: `001-ag-grid-preline`
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Integrate AG Grid with Preline Pro's design system to combine AG Grid's enterprise functionality with Preline's modern aesthetic"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Data in Modern Styled Table (Priority: P1)

As an end user, I want to view tabular data in a modern, visually appealing interface that matches the application's design system, so that the data table feels like a natural part of the application rather than a jarring third-party component.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation. Without visual integration, users will perceive the data table as poorly implemented or inconsistent. This story delivers immediate visual value and proves the integration concept works.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by rendering a data table with sample data and verifying that colors, fonts, spacing, and visual hierarchy match the application's existing design patterns. Delivers a cohesive, professional-looking data display.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application uses a light color scheme, **When** the data table renders, **Then** the table uses the same color palette (backgrounds, borders, text) as other application components
2. **Given** the application uses specific typography, **When** text appears in table cells and headers, **Then** fonts, sizes, and weights match the application's typography system
3. **Given** the data table is displayed alongside other UI components, **When** a user views the page, **Then** the table's visual style is indistinguishable from native application components
4. **Given** the application has dark mode enabled, **When** the data table renders, **Then** all table elements correctly display in dark mode colors
5. **Given** a user views the table on different screen sizes, **When** the viewport changes, **Then** the table maintains visual consistency and design system compliance

### User Story 2 - Search and Filter Data with Modern Controls (Priority: P2)

As an end user, I want to search and filter table data using modern, intuitive controls that match the application's design, so that I can quickly find specific records without learning new interaction patterns.

**Why this priority**: Search and filter are the most common data table operations. Modern, well-designed controls significantly improve user productivity and satisfaction. This builds on P1's visual foundation by adding interactive functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by entering search terms in the search bar and applying filters through dropdown menus, then verifying that the table updates correctly and all controls match the application's design system.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a data table with multiple records, **When** a user types in the search bar, **Then** the table filters to show only matching records in real-time
2. **Given** search results are displayed, **When** a user clears the search term, **Then** the table returns to showing all records
3. **Given** the table has filterable columns, **When** a user selects filter options from a dropdown, **Then** the table displays only records matching the selected criteria
4. **Given** multiple filters are active, **When** a user views the table, **Then** applied filters are clearly visible and can be removed individually
5. **Given** no records match the search or filter criteria, **When** the table updates, **Then** a user-friendly empty state message appears with suggested actions
6. **Given** the search bar and filter controls are rendered, **When** a user views them, **Then** they match the application's input field and dropdown styling

### User Story 3 - Sort and Paginate Large Datasets (Priority: P3)

As an end user, I want to sort columns and navigate through pages of data using controls that match the application's design, so that I can organize and browse large datasets efficiently.

**Why this priority**: Sorting and pagination are essential for working with large datasets but are less frequently used than search/filter. This story completes the core data table interaction set.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by clicking column headers to sort data in ascending/descending order, then using pagination controls to navigate between pages, verifying both functionality and visual design consistency.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a sortable column, **When** a user clicks the column header, **Then** the data sorts in ascending order and a visual indicator shows the sort direction
2. **Given** a column is sorted ascending, **When** a user clicks the same header again, **Then** the data sorts in descending order and the indicator updates
3. **Given** a large dataset spanning multiple pages, **When** pagination controls render, **Then** they match the application's button and navigation styling
4. **Given** the user is on page 2 of results, **When** the user clicks "Next", **Then** the table displays page 3 and updates the page indicator
5. **Given** 50 items per page is selected, **When** a user changes to 100 items per page, **Then** the table re-paginates and displays the correct number of records
6. **Given** sorting is applied, **When** a user navigates between pages, **Then** the sort order persists across all pages

---

### User Story 4 - Perform Advanced Data Operations (Priority: P4)

As an end user, I want to group, edit, and customize table views while maintaining the modern design aesthetic, so that I can perform complex data analysis and management tasks.

**Why this priority**: Advanced features (grouping, inline editing, column customization) serve power users and specific use cases. While valuable, they're not required for basic table functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by grouping rows by a column, editing cell values inline, and showing/hiding columns, then verifying that all advanced features work correctly and custom components maintain design consistency.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a table with a groupable column, **When** a user enables grouping by that column, **Then** rows are organized into expandable/collapsible groups
2. **Given** grouped data is displayed, **When** a user expands a group, **Then** the group header and expansion controls match the application's design system
3. **Given** an editable cell, **When** a user double-clicks to edit, **Then** an input field appears styled consistently with the application's form inputs
4. **Given** a user is editing a cell, **When** the user saves changes, **Then** the cell updates and displays success feedback matching the application's notification style
5. **Given** a table with many columns, **When** a user opens column visibility controls, **Then** a dropdown menu styled consistently with the application allows showing/hiding columns
6. **Given** custom column configurations are set, **When** the user returns to the page, **Then** the table remembers the user's preferences

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the table contains no data? Empty state must display a message styled consistently with the application's empty state patterns.
- What happens when a search returns no results? The system must show a "No results found" message with clear styling and suggest clearing filters.
- What happens when the user applies conflicting filters? The system must handle filter logic gracefully and provide clear feedback about active filters.
- What happens when data is loading? Loading states must use the application's loading indicators (spinners, skeletons) rather than default table loading states.
- What happens when the table needs to display very wide content? Horizontal scrolling must work smoothly while maintaining header and control visibility.
- What happens on mobile devices? The table must gracefully adapt to small screens while maintaining design consistency (may show fewer columns, responsive pagination).
- What happens when a user tries to sort by a non-sortable column? Visual feedback must indicate which columns are sortable using the application's interaction patterns.
- What happens during inline editing errors? Validation errors must display using the application's error message styling.

## Assumptions

1. **Design System Availability**: The application has a documented design system with defined color palettes, typography scales, spacing units, and component patterns that can be referenced during integration.

2. **Data Structure**: Table data will be provided in a structured format (array of objects) with consistent field names and data types suitable for tabular display.

3. **Browser Support**: The table needs to support modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) with versions released in the last 2 years. IE11 support is not required.

4. **Dataset Size**: Typical use cases involve datasets ranging from hundreds to tens of thousands of rows. Extremely large datasets (millions of rows) would require server-side pagination.

5. **Edit Permissions**: When inline editing is enabled, appropriate authorization checks are handled elsewhere in the application. The table's responsibility is to provide the editing interface.

6. **Responsive Strategy**: For mobile/tablet views, the table can adapt by showing fewer columns, stacking information, or providing a simplified view. Full desktop functionality on mobile is not required.

7. **Icon Library**: The application uses a standard icon library (e.g., Heroicons, Lucide) that provides icons needed for table operations (sort arrows, filter icons, expand/collapse).

8. **State Management**: User preferences and table state can be persisted using browser localStorage or similar client-side storage mechanism.

9. **Component Architecture**: The table will be implemented as reusable components that can be dropped into different pages of the application with minimal configuration.

10. **Testing Environment**: Sample data representative of real use cases is available for testing all table features and edge cases.
