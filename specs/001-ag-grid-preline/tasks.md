# Tasks: AG Grid with Preline Design Integration

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-ag-grid-preline/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are NOT requested in the specification. Tasks focus on implementation only.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Next.js 15 App Router**: `app/` for routes, `components/` for components, `lib/` for utilities
- All AG Grid components in `components/ag-grid/`
- Theme configuration in `lib/ag-grid/`
- Global CSS in `app/globals.css`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure for AG Grid integration

- [ ] T001 Create directory structure for AG Grid components at components/ag-grid/
- [ ] T002 Create directory structure for AG Grid utilities at lib/ag-grid/
- [ ] T003 Create directory structure for cell renderers at components/ag-grid/renderers/
- [ ] T004 Create directory structure for grid hooks at components/ag-grid/hooks/
- [ ] T005 Create directory structure for TypeScript types at lib/ag-grid/types/

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T006 Create TypeScript type definitions index file at lib/ag-grid/types/index.ts exporting all grid-related types from data-model.md and contracts
- [ ] T007 Create Preline theme configuration in lib/ag-grid/theme.ts implementing AG Grid Theming API with CSS custom properties bridge
- [ ] T008 Add CSS custom property mappings to app/globals.css for light mode (--ag-preline-bg, --ag-preline-fg, --ag-preline-accent, --ag-preline-font)
- [ ] T009 Add CSS custom property mappings to app/globals.css for dark mode using .dark selector
- [ ] T010 Add AG Grid CSS variable overrides to app/globals.css in @layer utilities for header colors, borders, and row hover states
- [ ] T011 Create grid utility functions in lib/ag-grid/utils.ts for common operations (format dates, format currency, generate column IDs)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - View Data in Modern Styled Table (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Search and Filter Data with Modern Controls (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Add toolbar with Preline-styled search bar and filter controls that work with AG Grid's filtering system

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently - grid has search and filter controls matching Preline design

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Sort and Paginate Large Datasets (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Add Preline-styled pagination controls and ensure sorting visual indicators match design system

**Independent Test**: Click column headers to sort, use pagination controls to navigate pages, verify Preline button and navigation styling

- [ ] T045 [US3] Add keyboard navigation support to GridPagination (arrow keys, enter, home, end) with proper ARIA labels

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional - grid has full pagination and sorting with Preline styling

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Perform Advanced Data Operations (Priority: P4)

**Goal**: Add row grouping, inline editing, and column customization features with Preline styling

**Independent Test**: Group rows by a column, edit cell values, toggle column visibility, verify all advanced features maintain Preline design consistency

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 DataGrid but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 DataGrid but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses US1 DataGrid and may reference US2 GridToolbar but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- **US1**: Core grid rendering tasks sequential (T012‚ÜíT013‚ÜíT014), styling tasks can run parallel after T014
- **US2**: Toolbar skeleton and search (T023-T026) can run parallel, dropdown and integration sequential
- **US3**: Pagination skeleton and button styling (T034-T036) can run parallel, logic and integration sequential
- **US4**: Cell renderers (T046-T047) can run parallel, grouping/editing/column features mostly sequential

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup Phase**: All 5 directory creation tasks (T001-T005) can run in parallel
- **Foundational Phase**: Type definitions (T006), theme (T007), and utilities (T011) can run in parallel; CSS tasks (T008-T010) sequential
- **User Story 1**: After core grid (T014), styling tasks T018-T021 can run in parallel
- **User Story 2**: Search input (T024) and filter dropdown button (T027) creation can run in parallel
- **User Story 3**: Pagination component (T034) and sort icon customization (T044) can run in parallel initially
- **User Story 4**: Cell renderers (T046-T047) can run in parallel; hooks (T056) independent from UI tasks
- **Polish Phase**: Documentation (T060-T061), accessibility checks (T062-T065), and optimization (T067-T068) can run in parallel

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (MVP)

```bash
# After Foundational phase complete, launch core grid tasks:
Task T012: Create DataGrid component skeleton
Task T013: Create useGridTheme hook
# Then after T014 (core rendering) completes, launch styling in parallel:
Task T018: Implement grid wrapper styling
Task T019: Add loading overlay support
Task T020: Add empty state support
Task T021: Implement responsive behavior
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T005)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T006-T011) - CRITICAL, blocks all stories
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T012-T022)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Render grid with sample data, verify Preline styling in light/dark modes
5. Deploy/demo if ready

**MVP Deliverable**: A visually integrated data grid that renders data with 100% Preline design system alignment

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready (T001-T011)
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP! T012-T022)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test search/filter ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (T023-T033)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test pagination/sort ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (T034-T045)
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test advanced features ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (T046-T059)
6. Polish Phase ‚Üí Final refinements ‚Üí Production release (T060-T070)

Each story adds value without breaking previous stories.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T011)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (T012-T022) - Core grid
   - **Developer B**: User Story 2 (T023-T033) - Search/filter toolbar
   - **Developer C**: User Story 3 (T034-T045) - Pagination
   - **Developer D**: User Story 4 (T046-T059) - Advanced features
3. Stories complete and integrate independently via shared DataGrid component

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- All components use `"use client"` directive (AG Grid requires client-side rendering)
- TypeScript strict mode enforced - no `any` types without justification
- All styling must use Preline design tokens via Tailwind CSS
- Dark mode support via `next-themes` is built into foundation (T008-T009)
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
