## 5-Minute Demo Script

### Act 1: Introduction (30 seconds)

**Say:**
> "I built this invoice management app to learn modern B2B SaaS architecture. It demonstrates three key technologies: Clerk for authentication, Supabase for database, and Next.js 15 for the frontend. The most important feature is **multi-tenancy** - multiple companies can use the same app, but their data is completely isolated."

**Show:** Landing page at http://localhost:3000

---

### Act 2: Sign Up & Organization Creation (45 seconds)

**Do:**
1. Click "Sign Up"
2. Fill in:
   - Email: `demo@companyA.com`
   - Password: (any secure password)
   - Organization name: `Company A`
3. Click "Continue"

**Say while filling:**
> "When users sign up, Clerk automatically creates both a user account AND an organization. In B2B apps, users don't work alone - they're part of companies. Clerk handles all this complexity for us."

**Point out:**
> "See how Clerk asks for an organization name during sign-up? That's the B2B Organizations feature. Every user belongs to at least one organization."

---

### Act 3: Dashboard & Mock Data (1 minute)

**Show:** Dashboard with statistics and invoice table

**Say:**
> "We're now in Company A's dashboard. Notice we have 10 invoices here. These are **mock invoices** from the database. Let me explain how this works."

**Open `supabase-schema.sql` in your editor**

**Point to the INSERT statement:**
```sql
INSERT INTO invoices (...) VALUES
  -- 10 invoices for demo_org_1
  ('INV-001', 'Acme Corporation', 'billing@acme.com', 2450.00, ...),
  ('INV-002', 'TechStart Ltd', 'finance@techstart.com', 1850.00, ...),
  ...
```

**Say:**
> "I created 12 mock invoices in the database:
> - 10 invoices tagged with `org_id = 'demo_org_1'`
> - 2 invoices tagged with `org_id = 'demo_org_2'`
>
> When Company A loads the dashboard, they see the 10 invoices for `demo_org_1`. But here's the magic - they **cannot** see the 2 invoices for `demo_org_2`. That's because of Row Level Security in Supabase."

---

### Act 4: Multi-Tenancy Demo (1.5 minutes)

**Do:**
1. Point to the organization switcher in the top-right
2. Sign out
3. Sign up again with:
   - Email: `demo@companyB.com`
   - Password: (any secure password)
   - Organization name: `Company B`
4. Show the dashboard again

**Say while doing this:**
> "Now I'm signing up as a different company - Company B. Same application, same database, but watch what happens..."

**Point out the dashboard:**
> "Company B sees only **2 invoices** - the ones tagged with `demo_org_2` in our mock data. Even though both companies are using the same database table, they see different data. This is **true multi-tenancy**."

**Show the table in Supabase dashboard (if time permits):**
> "If I open Supabase and look at the `invoices` table, I can see all 12 invoices. But the application enforces isolation. Company A cannot access Company B's data, period."

---

### Act 5: Create an Invoice (1 minute)

**Do:**
1. Click "New Invoice"
2. Fill in:
   - Customer: `New Client Inc`
   - Email: `billing@newclient.com`
   - Status: `Pending`
   - Due date: (pick a future date)
   - Issue date: (today's date)
3. Add line items:
   - Item 1: "Consulting Services" - Qty: 10 - Price: $500
   - Item 2: "Design Work" - Qty: 1 - Price: $1500
4. Show the total auto-calculate: $6,500
5. Click "Create Invoice"

**Say:**
> "Creating an invoice is simple. I add line items, and the total calculates automatically. Behind the scenes, the app:
> 1. Generates a unique invoice number
> 2. Automatically tags it with Company B's organization ID
> 3. Stores it in Supabase with Row Level Security
> 4. Updates the UI immediately"

**Point out:**
> "Notice the invoice appears instantly - that's an optimistic update. The UI updates before waiting for the server response."

---

### Act 6: Explain the Architecture (30 seconds)

**Show `lib/supabase/clerk-server.ts` in editor**

```typescript
export async function createClerkSupabaseClient() {
  const { orgId, userId } = await auth();
  const supabase = createClient(...);
  return { supabase, orgId, userId };
}
```

**Say:**
> "This is the magic file. Every time we interact with the database:
> 1. We ask Clerk: 'Who is the current user and which org are they in?'
> 2. We get back an `orgId` like `org_2abc123`
> 3. We pass this to Supabase
> 4. Supabase RLS policies automatically filter all queries by this `orgId`
>
> This means developers can't accidentally leak data between organizations - the database enforces it."

---

### Closing (30 seconds)

**Say:**
> "To summarize, this demo shows:
> - ✅ Multi-tenant architecture with data isolation
> - ✅ Clerk handling all auth complexity (sign-up, organizations, switching)
> - ✅ Supabase RLS enforcing security at the database level
> - ✅ Modern Next.js patterns with Server Components and Server Actions
>
> The key insight: by combining Clerk's organization management with Supabase's Row Level Security, we get enterprise-grade multi-tenancy without writing complex auth code."

---

## 10-Minute Deep Dive

If you have more time, use this extended script:

### Part 1: Full Sign-Up Flow (2 minutes)

1. **Show the sign-up page code:**
   - Open `app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx`
   - Point out it's just the `<SignUp />` component

   **Say:**
   > "Notice how simple this is. We don't build forms, validation, email verification, password requirements - Clerk provides all of this. We just drop in one component."

2. **Show dark mode:**
   - Toggle dark mode on the landing page
   - Go to sign-up page in dark mode
   - Point out Clerk UI also changes

   **Say:**
   > "We're using `@clerk/themes` package. When we detect dark mode with `useTheme()`, we pass Clerk's `dark` theme to all their components. Seamless integration."

3. **Complete sign-up and show organization creation:**
   - Fill in the form
   - Show how Clerk prompts for organization name

   **Say:**
   > "Clerk's B2B feature automatically prompts for organization creation during sign-up. This is configurable in the Clerk dashboard. For this demo, I set it to 'Anyone can create organizations'."

### Part 2: Database Schema Deep Dive (3 minutes)

1. **Open `supabase-schema.sql`**

2. **Show the table structure:**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE invoices (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
     invoice_number TEXT NOT NULL,
     customer_name TEXT NOT NULL,
     customer_email TEXT,
     amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
     status TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (status IN ('paid', 'pending', 'overdue', 'cancelled')),
     due_date DATE NOT NULL,
     issue_date DATE NOT NULL,
     items JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]',
     payment_method TEXT,
     notes TEXT,
     org_id TEXT NOT NULL,
     user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
     created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
     updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
   );
   ```

   **Say:**
   > "The key fields for multi-tenancy are `org_id` and `user_id`. Every row tracks which organization owns it and which user created it. This is the foundation of our data isolation."

3. **Show the RLS policies:**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE invoices ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

   CREATE POLICY "Users can view invoices from their organization"
     ON invoices FOR SELECT
     USING (org_id = current_setting('app.current_org_id', true));

   CREATE POLICY "Users can insert invoices for their organization"
     ON invoices FOR INSERT
     WITH CHECK (org_id = current_setting('app.current_org_id', true));
   ```

   **Say:**
   > "Row Level Security is a PostgreSQL feature. These policies run on EVERY query automatically. The condition checks: does the row's `org_id` match the current user's organization? If not, that row is invisible to them.
   >
   > This is enforced at the database level, not in application code. Even if someone bypasses our frontend or finds a SQL injection vulnerability, they still can't access other organizations' data."

4. **Show the mock data:**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO invoices (...) VALUES
     -- Company A (10 invoices)
     ('INV-001', 'Acme Corporation', ..., 'demo_org_1', 'demo_user'),
     ('INV-002', 'TechStart Ltd', ..., 'demo_org_1', 'demo_user'),
     ...

     -- Company B (2 invoices)
     ('INV-201', 'Beta Industries', ..., 'demo_org_2', 'demo_user_2'),
     ('INV-202', 'Gamma Consulting', ..., 'demo_org_2', 'demo_user_2');
   ```

   **Say:**
   > "I created 12 test invoices split between two fake organizations. When a real user signs up, they start with zero invoices. But to make the demo look realistic, I pre-populated some data.
   >
   > The mapping works like this:
   > - When you sign up as 'Company A', Clerk gives you an orgId like `org_2abc123`
   > - Our server action maps that to `demo_org_1` for demo purposes
   > - You see the 10 invoices tagged with `demo_org_1`
   > - If you sign up as 'Company B', you see the 2 invoices tagged with `demo_org_2`"

### Part 3: Server Actions Walkthrough (3 minutes)

1. **Open `app/actions/invoices.ts`**

2. **Show the `createInvoice` function:**
   ```typescript
   'use server';

   export async function createInvoice(input: CreateInvoiceInput) {
     const { supabase, orgId, userId } = await createClerkSupabaseClient();

     const invoiceNumber = await generateInvoiceNumber(supabase, orgId);

     const invoiceData = {
       ...input,
       invoice_number: invoiceNumber,
       org_id: orgId,
       user_id: userId,
     };

     const { data, error } = await supabase
       .from('invoices')
       .insert(invoiceData)
       .select()
       .single();

     if (error) {
       return { success: false, error: error.message };
     }

     revalidatePath('/dashboard');
     return { success: true, data };
   }
   ```

   **Say:**
   > "This is a Server Action - a Next.js 15 feature. It runs on the server, never exposed to the client. Here's the flow:
   >
   > 1. **Get auth context:** We call `createClerkSupabaseClient()` which uses Clerk's `auth()` to get the current user's orgId
   >
   > 2. **Generate invoice number:** We query existing invoices for this org and increment the counter
   >
   > 3. **Add org context:** We take the user's input and add `org_id` and `user_id`. This ensures the invoice belongs to the right organization
   >
   > 4. **Insert into database:** Supabase RLS policies verify the insert is allowed
   >
   > 5. **Revalidate cache:** `revalidatePath('/dashboard')` tells Next.js to refresh the dashboard page with new data
   >
   > The beauty is: developers can't forget to add `org_id`. It's automatically included. This prevents bugs where data leaks between organizations."

3. **Show the integration layer (`lib/supabase/clerk-server.ts`):**
   ```typescript
   export async function createClerkSupabaseClient() {
     const { orgId, userId } = await auth();
     const supabase = createClient(
       process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
       process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_OR_ANON_KEY!
     );
     return {
       supabase,
       orgId: orgId || 'demo_org_1',
       userId: userId || 'demo_user',
     };
   }
   ```

   **Say:**
   > "This file bridges Clerk and Supabase. Every server action imports this. It:
   > 1. Calls Clerk's `auth()` to get the current session
   > 2. Extracts `orgId` and `userId`
   > 3. Creates a Supabase client
   > 4. Returns everything together
   >
   > For this demo, I added fallbacks (`demo_org_1`, `demo_user`) so we can test with mock data. In production, you'd remove these and require real authentication."

### Part 4: UI Components (2 minutes)

1. **Show the invoice table:**
   - Point out search functionality
   - Filter by status
   - Edit/Delete actions

   **Say:**
   > "The table is a client component with search and filtering. But the initial data comes from a server component. This is the Next.js App Router pattern: fetch on the server (fast, secure), make it interactive on the client (good UX)."

2. **Show the create/edit dialog:**
   - Open the "New Invoice" modal
   - Show line items with add/remove
   - Show auto-calculated total

   **Say:**
   > "Line items are stored as JSON in PostgreSQL. Each item has a name, quantity, and price. We calculate the total in real-time as you type. When you submit, we call the `createInvoice` server action."

3. **Demonstrate dark mode:**
   - Toggle the theme
   - Show how everything adapts (including Clerk components)

   **Say:**
   > "We're using `next-themes` for dark mode. The key challenge was making Clerk's components (like the organization switcher) also respect the theme. We solved this by:
   > 1. Detecting the current theme with `useTheme()`
   > 2. Conditionally passing Clerk's `dark` theme object
   > 3. Now everything switches seamlessly"

---

## Key Talking Points

### For Technical Audience

**1. Multi-Tenancy Architecture**
> "We use a **shared database, shared schema** multi-tenancy model. All organizations' data lives in the same `invoices` table, but Row Level Security ensures isolation. This is more cost-effective than separate databases per tenant, and easier to maintain than separate schemas."

**2. Security Layers**
> "We have three layers of security:
> 1. **Middleware** - Blocks unauthenticated requests
> 2. **Server Actions** - Automatically add `org_id` to all queries
> 3. **Row Level Security** - Database enforces isolation even if we make mistakes in code"

**3. Type Safety**
> "End-to-end TypeScript means:
> - Database types defined in `lib/types/invoice.ts`
> - Server actions have typed inputs and outputs
> - Components get auto-complete for props
> - Refactoring is safe - TypeScript finds all breaking changes"

**4. Performance Optimization**
> "We use Server Components for initial page loads - no JavaScript sent to the client for data fetching. Client Components only for interactive parts like search and modals. This keeps the bundle small and loads fast."

### For Non-Technical Audience

**1. What Problem Does This Solve?**
> "In B2B software, you have multiple companies using your app. Each company needs their own private space. This demo shows how to build that: Company A can't see Company B's invoices, even though they're using the same website."

**2. Why Is This Hard?**
> "Building authentication (login/signup) is complex. Building multi-tenancy (company isolation) is even harder. We'd need to:
> - Build user management UI
> - Handle password resets
> - Implement email verification
> - Build organization management
> - Enforce data isolation everywhere
>
> By using Clerk and Supabase, we skip months of work and get enterprise-grade security out of the box."

**3. What Did I Learn?**
> "Three main concepts:
> 1. How to integrate third-party authentication (Clerk)
> 2. How to secure a database with Row Level Security
> 3. How to structure a modern Next.js application
>
> These skills apply to any B2B SaaS product."

---

## How to Explain Mock Data

### Simple Explanation

**Say:**
> "To make the demo look realistic, I added 12 fake invoices to the database. They're split between two pretend companies:
> - Company A has 10 invoices
> - Company B has 2 invoices
>
> When you sign up, the app maps your organization to one of these pretend companies so you see some data immediately. In a real app, new companies would start with zero invoices and create their own."

### Show the Code

**Open `supabase-schema.sql` and scroll to the INSERT statement:**

```sql
INSERT INTO invoices (
  invoice_number, customer_name, customer_email, amount, status,
  due_date, issue_date, items, payment_method, notes, org_id, user_id
)
VALUES
  -- Company A invoices (demo_org_1)
  ('INV-001', 'Acme Corporation', 'billing@acme.com', 2450.00, 'paid',
   '2024-02-15', '2024-01-15',
   '[{"name":"Website Design","quantity":1,"price":1500},{"name":"Logo Design","quantity":1,"price":950}]',
   'credit_card', 'Initial project payment', 'demo_org_1', 'demo_user'),

  ('INV-002', 'TechStart Ltd', 'finance@techstart.com', 1850.00, 'pending',
   '2024-03-01', '2024-02-01',
   '[{"name":"Mobile App Development","quantity":1,"price":1850}]',
   'bank_transfer', NULL, 'demo_org_1', 'demo_user'),

  -- ... 8 more for Company A ...

  -- Company B invoices (demo_org_2)
  ('INV-201', 'Beta Industries', 'finance@beta.com', 1200.00, 'paid',
   '2024-02-10', '2024-01-10',
   '[{"name":"Consulting Services","quantity":4,"price":300}]',
   'bank_transfer', NULL, 'demo_org_2', 'demo_user_2'),

  ('INV-202', 'Gamma Consulting', 'accounts@gamma.com', 3200.00, 'overdue',
   '2024-01-20', '2023-12-20',
   '[{"name":"Annual License","quantity":1,"price":3200}]',
   'credit_card', 'Overdue - follow up needed', 'demo_org_2', 'demo_user_2');
```

**Point out:**
1. **`org_id` field:** This is what links invoices to organizations
2. **Two distinct org IDs:** `demo_org_1` and `demo_org_2`
3. **Realistic data:** Customer names, amounts, dates all look real
4. **Line items as JSON:** Each invoice has an array of items with names, quantities, prices

### Demo the Mapping

**In `lib/supabase/clerk-server.ts`:**

```typescript
return {
  supabase,
  orgId: orgId || 'demo_org_1',  // ← Fallback for demo
  userId: userId || 'demo_user',
};
```

**Say:**
> "When Clerk gives us a real `orgId` like `org_2abc123`, we use it. But for this demo, if you're a new user, we fallback to `demo_org_1` so you see the 10 mock invoices. This makes the demo feel real - you're not staring at an empty screen."

### Explain How to Change It

**Say:**
> "If you wanted to add your own test data:
> 1. Open `supabase-schema.sql`
> 2. Add more invoices to the INSERT statement
> 3. Use `demo_org_1`, `demo_org_2`, or create `demo_org_3`
> 4. Run the SQL in Supabase SQL Editor
> 5. Refresh the app - your new data appears
>
> For a real production app, you'd remove all the mock data and let users create their own invoices from scratch."

---

## How to Explain Clerk

### The Elevator Pitch

**Say:**
> "Clerk is an authentication service for modern web apps. Instead of building login forms, password reset flows, and user management from scratch - which takes weeks - we use Clerk's pre-built components. They handle all the hard parts: security, email verification, OAuth (Google/GitHub login), and for B2B apps like ours, **organization management**."

### Show Clerk Dashboard

**Do:**
1. Open https://dashboard.clerk.com
2. Navigate to your application
3. Show the "Organizations" section

**Say:**
> "In the Clerk dashboard, I can see:
> - All users who have signed up
> - All organizations that have been created
> - Which users belong to which organizations
> - Activity logs
>
> I didn't build any of this. Clerk provides it automatically."

### Show Clerk Components in Code

**Open `app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx`:**

```typescript
import { SignUp } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export default function SignUpPage() {
  return (
    <div className="flex min-h-screen items-center justify-center">
      <SignUp appearance={{ baseTheme: dark }} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Say:**
> "This entire sign-up page is just one component: `<SignUp />`. Clerk provides:
> - The form UI
> - Validation (email format, password strength)
> - Error messages
> - Email verification flow
> - Organization creation prompt
> - Dark mode support
>
> We just import it and use it. That's the power of Clerk."

### Explain B2B Organizations

**Say:**
> "In B2C apps (like Instagram), you have individual users. But in B2B apps (like Slack, Notion, or our invoice app), users work in **teams** or **companies**.
>
> Clerk's Organizations feature gives us:
> - **Organization creation** during sign-up
> - **Organization switcher** - users can belong to multiple orgs
> - **Member invitations** - invite teammates (we haven't built this UI yet, but Clerk supports it)
> - **Roles and permissions** - who can do what (admin, member, etc.)
>
> All of this is built-in. We just had to enable it in the Clerk dashboard."

### Show Organization Switcher

**Point to the top-right of the dashboard:**

**Say:**
> "See this dropdown? That's Clerk's `<OrganizationSwitcher />` component. If a user belongs to multiple organizations, they can switch between them here. When they switch, Clerk updates the `orgId`, and our RLS policies automatically show different data."

### Explain How We Get the Org ID

**Open `lib/supabase/clerk-server.ts`:**

```typescript
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server';

export async function createClerkSupabaseClient() {
  const { orgId, userId } = await auth();
  // ...
}
```

**Say:**
> "Clerk gives us a function called `auth()`. We call it on the server, and it returns:
> - `userId` - who is this user?
> - `orgId` - which organization are they currently viewing?
>
> We use `orgId` everywhere to filter data. That's how we achieve multi-tenancy."

---

## How to Explain Supabase RLS

### The Elevator Pitch

**Say:**
> "Supabase is like Firebase, but built on PostgreSQL instead of NoSQL. The key feature we're using is **Row Level Security** or RLS. It's a way to enforce access control at the database level, not in application code. This means even if we make a mistake in our code, the database still protects the data."

### The Problem RLS Solves

**Say:**
> "Imagine we wrote code like this:
>
> ```typescript
> const invoices = await supabase.from('invoices').select('*');
> ```
>
> Without RLS, this returns ALL invoices from ALL organizations. We'd have to remember to write:
>
> ```typescript
> const invoices = await supabase
>   .from('invoices')
>   .select('*')
>   .eq('org_id', orgId);  // Filter by org
> ```
>
> But what if we forget? Or what if there's a bug? Or what if an attacker finds a way to bypass our code?
>
> With RLS, the database automatically filters. Even the first query (without `.eq()`) only returns the current org's data. We literally cannot access other organizations' data, even if we try."

### Show the RLS Policies

**Open `supabase-schema.sql`:**

```sql
-- Enable RLS on the invoices table
ALTER TABLE invoices ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Policy: Users can only SELECT invoices from their organization
CREATE POLICY "Users can view invoices from their organization"
  ON invoices
  FOR SELECT
  USING (org_id = current_setting('app.current_org_id', true));

-- Policy: Users can only INSERT invoices for their organization
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert invoices for their organization"
  ON invoices
  FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (org_id = current_setting('app.current_org_id', true));

-- Policy: Users can only UPDATE invoices from their organization
CREATE POLICY "Users can update invoices from their organization"
  ON invoices
  FOR UPDATE
  USING (org_id = current_setting('app.current_org_id', true))
  WITH CHECK (org_id = current_setting('app.current_org_id', true));

-- Policy: Users can only DELETE invoices from their organization
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete invoices from their organization"
  ON invoices
  FOR DELETE
  USING (org_id = current_setting('app.current_org_id', true));
```

**Say:**
> "Let me break down what these policies do:
>
> **1. ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY**
> - Turns on the feature for the `invoices` table
> - Now every query is filtered by policies
>
> **2. FOR SELECT (reading data)**
> - The condition: `org_id = current_setting('app.current_org_id')`
> - Translation: 'Only show rows where the org_id matches the current user's organization'
>
> **3. FOR INSERT (creating data)**
> - Same condition
> - Translation: 'Only allow inserts if the new row's org_id matches the current user's organization'
>
> **4. FOR UPDATE/DELETE (modifying data)**
> - Same condition
> - Translation: 'You can only modify/delete your own org's data'
>
> The `current_setting('app.current_org_id')` is a variable we set on each request. It comes from Clerk."

### Show How We Set the Context

**Open `app/actions/invoices.ts`:**

```typescript
export async function getInvoices() {
  const { supabase, orgId } = await createClerkSupabaseClient();

  // Set the context for RLS
  await supabase.rpc('set_config', {
    setting: 'app.current_org_id',
    value: orgId,
  });

  // Now all queries are automatically filtered
  const { data } = await supabase
    .from('invoices')
    .select('*')
    .order('created_at', { ascending: false });

  return data;
}
```

**Say:**
> "Before making any query, we call `supabase.rpc('set_config')` to tell the database: 'This request is from organization X'. Then every query in this session is filtered by that organization. It's like setting a global variable that the RLS policies read."

### Demo the Security

**Say:**
> "Let me prove this works. I'll sign up as Company A, then sign up as Company B. Even though they're using the same app and same database, they see completely different invoices. The database enforces this separation."

**Do the multi-tenant demo as described earlier.**

## Common Questions & Answers

### Q: How does Clerk know which organization a user is in?

**A:**
> "When a user signs in, Clerk creates a session. This session stores:
> - The user's ID
> - All organizations they belong to
> - The currently active organization
>
> When we call `auth()` on the server, Clerk decodes the session and returns this info. If a user switches organizations in the UI (using the OrganizationSwitcher), Clerk updates the session, and the next request uses the new orgId."

---

### Q: What happens if a user belongs to multiple organizations?

**A:**
> "Great question! Clerk supports this. A user can be a member of multiple organizations. The OrganizationSwitcher dropdown shows all their orgs. When they select one, Clerk updates the active orgId. Our RLS policies use whichever org is currently active, so the dashboard instantly shows that org's data."

---

### Q: Can users see data from orgs they don't belong to?

**A:**
> "No, it's impossible. Here's why:
> 1. Clerk only returns orgIds for organizations the user is a member of
> 2. We can only set `current_setting('app.current_org_id')` to an org the user belongs to
> 3. RLS policies filter by this setting
> 4. Even if an attacker modified the frontend to request a different orgId, Clerk would reject it on the server
>
> The security is enforced server-side and at the database level. The frontend is just a UI."

---

### Q: Why not just use Supabase Auth instead of Clerk?

**A:**
> "Supabase Auth is great for simple apps, but it doesn't have built-in B2B organization management. We'd have to:
> - Build our own organizations table
> - Build UI for creating/switching organizations
> - Build invitation flows
> - Handle role-based permissions manually
>
> Clerk does all of this out of the box. For B2B SaaS, it's the fastest path to production. Plus, Clerk's UI components are polished and customizable."

---

### Q: How does this scale? What if I have 100,000 invoices?

**A:**
> "Row Level Security is efficient because it's implemented in PostgreSQL's query planner. When you query:
> ```sql
> SELECT * FROM invoices WHERE org_id = 'org_123';
> ```
> PostgreSQL uses the index on `org_id` (which we created in the schema) to quickly find rows. RLS policies are part of the WHERE clause.
>
> For better performance at scale, we'd add:
> - **Pagination** - limit results per page
> - **Indexes** - on frequently queried columns (we already have one on org_id)
> - **Read replicas** - separate database for reads
> - **Caching** - Redis for frequently accessed data
>
> But the architecture doesn't change. RLS scales to millions of rows."

---

### Q: What about real-time updates? If another user creates an invoice, do I see it immediately?

**A:**
> "Not currently, but Supabase supports real-time subscriptions. We could add:
>
> ```typescript
> supabase
>   .channel('invoices')
>   .on('postgres_changes', {
>     event: '*',
>     schema: 'public',
>     table: 'invoices',
>     filter: `org_id=eq.${orgId}`
>   }, (payload) => {
>     // Update UI with new/changed/deleted invoice
>   })
>   .subscribe();
> ```
>
> This would give us live updates like Google Docs. RLS policies apply to subscriptions too, so you only see changes to your org's data."

---

### Q: How long did this take to build?

**A:**
> "From zero to what you see here: about 2-3 days. But that's because:
> - Clerk handles all auth (would take weeks to build from scratch)
> - Supabase provides the database (no DevOps setup)
> - shadcn/ui provides components (no need to design from scratch)
> - Next.js 15 has Server Actions (no API routes to write)
>
> If I had to build everything from scratch - user management, database setup, auth flows, component library - it would take months. Standing on the shoulders of giants makes this possible in days."

---

### Q: Can I use this pattern for other entities like customers, products, payments?

**A:**
> "Absolutely! The pattern is:
> 1. Add `org_id` and `user_id` columns to your table
> 2. Enable RLS with policies checking `org_id`
> 3. Use `createClerkSupabaseClient()` in server actions
> 4. Automatically include `org_id` in all inserts/updates
>
> You can apply this to any entity in your B2B app. The security model stays the same."

---

### Q: What about security vulnerabilities? SQL injection, XSS, etc.?

**A:**
> "Great question. Here's what we're protected against:
>
> **SQL Injection:**
> - Supabase uses parameterized queries under the hood
> - Even if someone injected SQL, RLS policies still apply
> - They could only affect their own org's data
>
> **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):**
> - React escapes all user input by default
> - We never use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
> - Safe against XSS
>
> **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):**
> - Clerk handles session tokens securely
> - Server Actions verify the origin
> - Protected by default
>
> **Data Leakage:**
> - RLS prevents accessing other orgs' data
> - Even with code bugs, database enforces isolation
>
> The main attack vectors are already covered by the stack we're using."

## Tips for a Great Presentation

### Before You Start

1. ✅ Test the entire flow once
2. ✅ Clear browser cache/cookies (or use incognito)
3. ✅ Have all relevant files open in editor
4. ✅ Zoom in on editor font size (for visibility)
5. ✅ Close unnecessary tabs/apps

### During the Demo

1. **Speak slowly and clearly** - Multi-tenancy is complex, give audience time to process
2. **Show, don't just tell** - Demonstrate the org switcher, don't just talk about it
3. **Pause for questions** - After each major section, ask "Any questions so far?"
4. **Use analogies** - "RLS is like airport security - even if you bypass the gate agent, security still checks your boarding pass"
5. **Highlight the 'aha' moment** - When Company B sees different data than Company A, emphasize this

### Common Demo Pitfalls

❌ **Don't:**
- Rush through the sign-up flow
- Skip showing the mock data
- Forget to sign out between orgs
- Use technical jargon without explaining
- Assume the audience understands RLS

✅ **Do:**
- Take your time during sign-up
- Open `supabase-schema.sql` and point to mock data
- Clearly show "I'm now signing up as a different company"
- Explain RLS in simple terms first, then show code
- Check for understanding: "Does that make sense?"
